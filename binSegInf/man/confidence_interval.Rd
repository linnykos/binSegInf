\title{TG confidence interval from post-selection inference. Assumes that one-sided
test is in the right-sided direction i.e. H_0: v^T\mu>0.}
\usage{
confidence_interval(y, polyhedra, contrast, sigma = 1, alpha = 0.05,
  gridsize = 250, alternative = c("two.sided", "one.sided"),
  precBits = NA, fac = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{numeric vector}

\item{polyhedra}{polyhedra object}

\item{contrast}{contrast numeric vector}

\item{sigma}{numeric to denote the sd of the residuals}

\item{alpha}{numeric between 0 and 1 with default of 0.95. This is the
significance level, guaranteeing that alpha percentage of the intervals
will cover the true parameter.}

\item{gridsize}{numeric to denote how fine of a grid to invert the hypothesis
test}

\item{alternative}{string of either "one.sided" or "two.sided" for the
alternative. If one.sided, the alternative means the test statistic is
positive.}

\item{precBits}{precision of Rmpfri}

\item{fac}{A positive factor that makes the search over \eqn{v^T\mu} to be
over a range of \code{(-fac*(max(y)-min(y)), fac*(max(y)- min(y)))}.
Defaults to \code{10}.}
}
\value{
a vector of two numbers, the lower and upper end of the confidence interval
}
