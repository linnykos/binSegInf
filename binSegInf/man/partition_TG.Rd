\title{From polyhedron and data vector and contrast, gets the probability that vtY
is in the polyhedron, conditional on PvperpY. i.e. the probability that Y
stays in the polyhedron, fixing n-1 dimensions of it.}
\usage{
partition_TG(y, poly, v, sigma, nullcontrast = 0, bits = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{data}

\item{poly}{polyhedra object produced form \code{polyhedra(wbs_object)}}

\item{v}{contrast vector}

\item{sigma}{data noise (standard deviation)}

\item{nullcontrast}{the null value of \eqn{v^T\mu}, for \eqn{\mu = E(y)}.}
}
\value{
list of two vectors: denominators and numerators, each named
    \code{denom} and \code{numer}.
